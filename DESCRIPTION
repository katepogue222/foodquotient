Description: The foodqotient package was created to aid in analysing data from 
    a food frequency questionaire known as the Harvard Service Food Frequency 
    Questionaire (HSFFQ).
    Functions from this package take answers of the HSFFQ and generate 
    estimates of daily consumed micronutrients, calories, macronutrients on 
    an indevidual level.
    The package is also capable of calculating food quotients on an indevidual 
    and group level, which aides in the calculation of total energy expenidture
    (TEE) using the doubly labeled water (DLW) method, which is the gold 
    standard for measuring TEE.
