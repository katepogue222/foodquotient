# foodquotient
The foodquotient package was created to estimate food quotients and daily nutrient intake on a group and individual level from responses to the Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionnaire. 

# Usage
To perform FFQ analysis using the foodquotient package, the user must posess data gathered using the Harvard Service Food Frequency Questionaire (HSFFQ), including the age of each participant as well as each participant's coded responses to 85 food frequency questions. More information about gathering data using the HSFFQ can be found at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health Nutrition Department's file download site. An example dataframe titled "age_freq" is included in the foodquotient package as an example of the dataframe structure needed to perform analysis using the foodquotient package. It is reccomended that the user wrangle their data into the structure of this example dataframe in order to apply the functions included in the foodquotient package.
